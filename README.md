# March Madness Analysis
Creating the perfect bracket!

## Description
Using previous March Madness data to help me predict games for my bracket this year. Using a dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017). The data has a lot wide variety of information for the past ~32 years of March Madness!

Currently the model shows the probability of each seed winning the first game of the tournament (Round 1).

## Future Plans
1. Implement a decision tree to decide the winner for each game.
2. Implement a Q-Learning Algorithm to determine winner for each game.
3. Implement a Neural Network (using Keras most likely...) to determine winner of each game.
