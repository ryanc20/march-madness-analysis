# March Madness Analysis
Creating the perfect bracket!

## Description
Using previous March Madness data to help me predict games for my bracket this year. Using a dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017). The data has a lot wide variety of information for the past ~32 years of March Madness!

## Generated Bracket

## Future Plans
1. ~~Implement a decision tree to decide the winner for each game.~~
2. Implement a Q-Learning Algorithm to determine winner for each game based on previous years. (Finished)
3. Implement a Neural Network (using Keras most likely...) to determine winner of each game. (If time permits)
